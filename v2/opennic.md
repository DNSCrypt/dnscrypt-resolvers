# *** THIS LIST IS FOR OLD DNSCRYPT-PROXY VERSIONS ***

Version 2 of the list is for dnscrypt-proxy <= 2.0.42 users.

If you are running up-to-date software, replace `/v2/` with `/v3/` in the sources URLs
of the `dnscrypt-proxy.toml` file (relevant lines start with `urls = ['https://...']`
and are present in the `[sources]` section).

THIS LIST IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED AS A SUBSET OF THE V3 LIST. DO NOT EDIT IT MANUALLY.

If you want to contribute changes to a resolvers list, only edit files from the `v3` directory.
