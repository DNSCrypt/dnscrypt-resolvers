# parental-control

A set of resolvers blocking popular websites that may not be appropriate
for children.

This is not bulletproof. In particular, websites in languages that are
not English will require additional, local rules.

To use that list, add this to the `[sources]` section of your
`dnscrypt-proxy.toml` configuration file:

    [sources.'parental-control']
    urls = ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v3/parental-control.md', 'https://download.dnscrypt.info/resolvers-list/v3/parental-control.md']
    minisign_key = 'RWQf6LRCGA9i53mlYecO4IzT51TGPpvWucNSCh1CBM0QTaLn73Y7GFO3'
    cache_file = 'parental-control.md'

In order to enforce safe search results from Google and Youtube, you may
also want to enable cloaking (`cloaking_rules` in the configuration file).
