# ODoH

Oblivious DoH DNS servers and relays.

By convention, entries whose name start with `odohrelay-` prefix are *relays* and names with an `odoh-` prefix are servers that can be reached through ODoH relays.

Note that ODoH relays cannot be used with DNSCrypt servers, and DNSCrypt relays cannot be used to connect to ODoH servers.

ODoH relays can also only connect to servers supporting the ODoH protocol, not regular DoH servers.

In other words, only combine elements from that list together.

To use that list, add this to the `[sources]` section of your `dnscrypt-proxy.toml` configuration file:

[sources.'odoh']
urls = ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v3/odoh.md', 'https://download.dnscrypt.info/resolvers-list/v3/odoh.md']
minisign_key = 'RWQf6LRCGA9i53mlYecO4IzT51TGPpvWucNSCh1CBM0QTaLn73Y7GFO3'
cache_file = 'odoh.md'
