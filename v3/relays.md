# Anonymized DNS relays

Anonymized DNS is a lightweight alternative to Tor and SOCKS proxies,
dedicated to DNS traffic. They hide the client IP address to DNS resolvers,
providing anonymity in addition to confidentiality and integrity.

DNS Anonymization is only compatible with servers supporting the
DNSCrypt protocol.
